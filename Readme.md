As events unfold in the world, social media becomes the place people engage with news and social issues. Social Cloud is a web experience that visualizes  real-time Twitter trends by location. The intuitive user interface includes Hashtags that are sized according to Tweet volume, and clicking on a trending hashtag will bring the user to the topic on Twitter.
